# StackUp-Zendesk-Bot
The repo contains code for building a discord chatbot that uses StackUp's Zendesk articles to retrieve information and answer a user's query. The bot uses LLMs and vector embeddings stored in Atlas MongoDB to efficiently search for closest information and responds through Discord's Embeds.
